# Non-cognitive Skills
codes for the research on non-cognitive skills based on the OECD Survey on Social and Emotional Skills

The original data comes from here
https://www.oecd.org/education/ceri/social-emotional-skills-study/

These data are currently used to carry out two research projects
1) Non-Cognitive Skills and Academic Performance (comparative study of 10- and 15-year old schoolchildren in all the cities where the survey was carried out)
2) Non-Cognitive Skills and Plans to Pursue Tertiary Education (study of 15-year old schoolchildren in Moscow, Russia)
